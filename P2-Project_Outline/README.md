# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I will be making a Choose Your Own Adventure game. I love the work of horror artist Emily Caroll, who makes innovative (and unsettling) interactive comics like <a href="http://emcarroll.com/comics/margot/index.html">Margot's Room</a>. I am also inspired by picrews, which let you build your own character, and personality quiz sites like uquiz. The primary goal is to focus on the playthrough side of the game, and create something which functions and is entertaining.
### Features
<b>Forms/User Input</b>: Users will be able to select choices in the game that, when submitted, will lead to different outcomes.<br>
<b>Audio</b>: Users can turn sound effects off and on.<br>
<b>Save Button</b>: Users can save their progress so they can come back to where they left off, or retract a decision they didn't like without having to start over from the beginning.
### Technologies
C#, HTML, maybe CSS and JavaScript
### What I'll Have to Learn
How to include sound (and a pause/play button)<br>
How to implement saving, possibly using cookies
